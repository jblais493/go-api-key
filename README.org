Simple tool for generating an API key for any application


** Running with nix:

Simply type this into your terminal and press enter
#+begin_src bash
nix run github:jblais493/go-api-key
#+end_src

You will be asked the name of your app, and the outputted a API key that you can keep safe with [[https://github.com/FiloSottile/age][age]], [[https://www.passwordstore.org/
][pass]], [[https://linux.die.net/man/1/gpg][gpg]], whatever you choose.

You can then alias this in your shell profile to whatever you like. I use ~keygen~.
